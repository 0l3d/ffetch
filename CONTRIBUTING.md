# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here’s how you can get involved:

## Mailing List (Recommended)
The best way to communicate, report bugs, or contribute is via our public community mailing list:
- **Email:** ~oled/dev@lists.sr.ht
- **Subscribe:** ~oled/dev+subscribe@lists.sr.ht
- **List:** https://lists.sr.ht/~oled/dev

This ensures faster responses and lets other contributors see and reply to your questions or issues.

## GitHub
You can also submit a Pull Request or open an Issue on GitHub. Keep in mind that responses may take longer and fewer people may see your report compared to the mailing list.

Thank you for helping improve the project!
