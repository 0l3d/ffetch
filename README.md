# F-Fetch
F-Fetch targets low systems. Written in Rust. It's very simple, designed so you can pick it up and replace it.

## First Look 

```sh
    ----------------------------------------------------
    |                F-FETCH
    | USERNAME : sh@sh
    | OS NAME : "Arch Linux"
    | KERNEL VERSION : 6.4.2-arch1-1
    | DESKTOP ENV : Unknown: bspwm
    | MEMORY : 6577 / 12441 MB
    | CPU : CPU | x86_64
    |                                                 
    ----------------------------------------------------
```
It is far from colors and visuals! Focused on function only!
